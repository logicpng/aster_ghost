Content Warnings:
! Unreality - No 4th wall, meta themes. An optional function addresses some software you've used while the Ukagaka was running, it's not enabled by default.
! Photosensitivity - Character often vibrates in place, in short bursts. You will be given the option to disable this when running for the first time and in the options of the ghost later.

Note: Fast-forwarding is not recommended, as it can break certain events.

Result: MIXED

Trying to upload the program onto the server was successful.

The data might not be complete, but that's not a problem for now... All that matters is that it works in the sandbox.

Compiling from the code alone is useless for me, naturally, should've known that, but this is a good sign.
