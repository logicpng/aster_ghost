Content Warnings:
! Unreality - No 4th wall, meta themes. An optional function addresses some software you've used while the Ukagaka was running, it's not enabled by default.
! Photosensitivity - Character often vibrates in place, in short bursts. Enable "Ignore SERIKO move" in SSP's Preferences (Ghost (2) > Ignore SERIKO Move) if this may cause an issue.

Note: It is recommended to have the font Roboto Condensed installed.

Trying to upload the program onto the server was successful.

The data might not be complete, but that's not a problem for now... All that matters is that it works in the sandbox.
